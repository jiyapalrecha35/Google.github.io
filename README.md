**Challenge 10: Graph Case Study Challenge**

Well, this challenge was announced as a festival bonus. The class is supposed to bring a solution to an interesting [graph case study](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/challenges/graph-case-study.pdf). The solution will be discussed on 9 Oct 2019 at 4.45pm. The best design solution will win bonus marks for minor 2. 


**Challenge 11: 100 Again**

100 Again was conducted on 04 Nov 2019. The class was divided into even and odd team. The challenge questions can be found [here](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/100-again.pdf). The class attendance was low (45/72) which was a little disappointing. Odd team Won the Challenge. 


**Challenge 12: Mock Minor 2**

Mock minor question paper was given to students to be solved as diwali take home assignment. The question paper can be accessed [here](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/dsa-mock-minor-2.pdf).

## Course Resources

**Chapter 01: Fundamentals of Algorithms and Problem Solving**

We started off the course with motivation and [MATH FOUNDATIONS](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/1-math-foundations.pdf). The chapter is about understanding the fundamental problem types and analyzing efficiency with respect to time. [INTRODUCTION NOTES](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/1-intro-to-algorithms.pdf) cover the summary.  We did solve 23 problems using [EXERCISE HANDOUT](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/1-exercise-handout.pdf). 


**Chapter 02: Hashing and Hash Tables**

Hashing is a black box. The [INTRODUCTORY NOTES](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/2-hashing-intro.pdf) cover the evolution and popular hash algorithms. Refer to [HASHING EBOOK](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/737188) for more details. Kindly note that two concepts were given for self-study as homework. Forget not to cover them. 


**Chapter 03: Graphs and Trees**

We realized that most real time scenarios are hierarchical and we need trees. Here is the introductory notes: [GRAPHS AND TREES](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/3-graphs-and-trees.pdf). Do refer class notes for more and various examples. We covered two IMPORTANT graph algorithms [DFS AND BFS](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/3-dfs-bfs.pdf) and a promising data structure [TRIE](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/3-trie.pdf). Keep all the code and other handouts given in the class with you! 


**Minor 01**

The class has performed with an average score of 14/20 with 5 students scoring 20/20. [Minor 01 Solutions](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/dsa-minor1-solutions.pdf)


**Chapter 04: Sorting Algorithms**

Sorting could be a task or a subtask to achieve a task. The basics sorts: Bubble, selection and insertion can be read here: [BUBBLE-INSERTION-SELECTION](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/4-bubble-selection-insertion.pdf) and the merge, quick and heap can be read here: [MERGE-QUICK-HEAP](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/4-merge-quick-heap.pdf). Forget not be well versed with efficiency analysis of each. Heap, the most important of all - [HEAP EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS](). You can also look for [SORTING ALGORITHMS HANDOUT](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/4-sorting-algorithms-handout.pdf).


**Chapter 05: Substring Search Algorithms**

We have studied four major substring search algorithms. Brute Force, Boyer-Moore, KMP and Rabin-Karp. Plelase refer to class notes for Rabin-Karp. Remaining notes can be read here: [SUBSTRING SEARCH ALGORITHMS](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/5-string-search-algorithms.pdf). Refer class notes for more examples. 


**Chapter 06: Graph Algorithms**

Graphs rule the world. They are the future. Read, understand and realize the shortest paths and spanning trees algorithms. [GRAPH ALGORITHMS](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/6-graph-algorithms.pdf). Forget not to read the Graphs handbook [HANDBOOK](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/6-graphs-handbook.pdf) - which has more examples, intuition, algorithm and efficiency analysis. 



**Minor 02**

The class has performed with an average score of 14/20 with 2 students scoring 20/20. [Minor 02 Solutions](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/dsa-minor2-solutions.pdf)


**Chapter 07: Problem Case Studies**

In this chapter we see different problem types and their analysis and advantages. They vary over different design techniques. Study [PROBLEM CASE STUDIES](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/7-problem-case-studies.pdf). There is also a supporting notes that briefs through different design techniques studied so far: [ALGORITHM DESIGN TECHNIQUES](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/7-algorithm-design-techniques.pdf).


**Chapter 08: Limitations of Algorithm Power**

Nopes, machines cannot solve everything. There are more languages than Turing Machines. Here is a summary notes of the chapter: [LIMITATIONS OF ALGORITHM](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/8-algorithm-limitations.pdf).
